    <h4 class="content-heading">About OZOZ photography</h4>
    <p class="content-paragraph">
      <p> Ahmad Osama is an independent, Egyptian photograher, based in prague. 
        While living in Egypt, Ahmad's eyes grew accoustmed to find beuty where most do not look.
        The bustling life of cairo, along with the intellectual isolation of living in contemprory
        Egyptian society, and the dysphoria of finding his identity as a middle-eastern man in Europe,
        have turned Ahmad to the surreal moments that we all experience in our day to day life, with invigorating
        controversy and relatability.
        <br>
    
        Ahmad also took a keen interest in the human experience and seeks to capture the moments of
        genuine emotional expression, a skill he acquired by operating from the shadows of the crowds of
        humans we pass everyday.  
        <br>
    
        Ahmad is not only a beacon of artistic expression with his utilisation of Candid, Urban, and Abstract
        in street photography. His understanding of his equipment and lighting allows him to stand out in
        professional photography, where he provides his clients with unique and time-less proffesional portraits.
