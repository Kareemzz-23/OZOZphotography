            <h1>About OZOZ Photography</h1>
            <p>
                Ahmad Osama is an independent, Egyptian photographer, based in Prague. 
                While living in Egypt, Ahmad's eyes grew accustomed to finding beauty where most do not look.
                The bustling life of Cairo, along with the intellectual isolation of living in contemporary
                Egyptian society, and the dysphoria of finding his identity as a middle-eastern man in Europe,
                have turned Ahmad to the surreal moments that we all experience in our day-to-day life, with invigorating
                controversy and relatability. His techniques blend the barriers between structure and flow, challenging 
                how we see and percieve life.
                <br><br>
                Ahmad also took a keen interest in the human experience and seeks to capture the moments of
                genuine emotional expression, a skill he acquired by operating from the shadows of the crowds of
                humans we pass every day.  
                <br><br>
                Ahmad is not only a beacon of artistic expression with his utilization of Candid, Urban, and Abstract
                in street photography. His understanding of his equipment and lighting allows him to stand out in
                professional photography, where he provides his clients with unique and timeless professional portraits.
